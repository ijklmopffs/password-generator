# Password Generator App

This is a website that helps you generate a password by mixing random characters together, depending on your inputs and selection.

It also gives feedback on the strength of the generated password according to inputs selected, ranging from one being too weak, to four being strong, with different colors to showcase the strength of the password.

It also has a copy button that copies generated text to password, and a little feedback text to show if the password has been copied.
